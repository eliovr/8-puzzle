# 8-Puzzle
This a Scala implementation of the smaller version of the
[15-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) game, the 8-puzzle.
It provides a set up for those who are interested in coding search algorithms
using Scala.

There are no spoilers on the search algorithms, just an implementation of the
problem.
